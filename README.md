## tsujisalju's portfolio source code

Welcome! This is the source code for my portfolio website. It serves as a showcase for my artworks and projects, as well as an ongoing exercise to learn how to use Nextjs, Tailwindcss and write Typescript. I intentionally make it open source so I could share my cool findings with you.

This website is based on the Nextjs personal website tutorial, but now expanded with the following features:

- responsive design
- light/dark mode toggle
- language support for posts
- and more!

You can take a look at the code to help mix and match stuff with your own portfolio website, but my artworks are my intellectual property.

A long-term development plan for this website would be to make an all-in-one self-hosted artist commissioning and distribution system doohicky, but that is long-term. Keep an eye out as I piece it together.

## Nextjs related thing

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
